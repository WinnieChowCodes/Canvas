# Important GitHub Reminders
 - When uploading your work remember to create an new branch - NEVER upload to the main branch
 - Name your branch patch_n , where n is the test case ID given in the test case document
 - When creating a Pull Request, write a show sentence telling me what you are commiting
 - Please wait until I confirm that you can merge into the main branch; this way we can avoid any bugs and errors in the long term
